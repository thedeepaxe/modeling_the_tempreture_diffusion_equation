#modeling_the_tempreture_diffusion_equation

This project is one of the projects I take the most pride in. As it connects math visualization, math modeling, and optimization-solving algorithms(linear regression).
In what follows, we will go over the next chapters:

## heavy influence from 3B1b

3blue1brown, it all started with this youtube channel that models any math problem and makes it easier to understand. I have always been mesmerized by the way it simplifies the toughest and most demanding of problems.So As these videos were created python code instead of the usual montage software. the first hurdle was to learn how  to use the manim library that was created by 3B1B channel Grant Sanderson.

## manim as a library

Manim is an engine for precise programmatic animations, designed for creating explanatory math videos.it's a free and open-source project originally written by Grant Sanderson. It is now maintained by the Manim Community and permissively released under the MIT license.

## project description

First I had to model the heat dissipation phenomenon. I had to show all the math that lead to the equation that could solve our problem. then, explaining the reasoning behind the linear regression, a solution was reached. 

this video was the final result.
